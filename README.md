# Roadmap2AGI (TIPS)
1. Evaulation is very important. Common benchmarks may be already included in the pretraining. Brand new datasets are needed.
2. Determining AGI is difficult. There may be luck and randomness. Finding the correct checkpoint with the correct evaluation is important.
3. It's expensive to explore everything in LLM era. Making decisions is important.
4. Many things can actually be coded in python with a small loss of speed but a great gain of coding efficiency.
5. Check the number of parameters before a fair comparison. Scaling law really matters.
6. The ability to learn complex problems from atomic problems is still mysterious.
